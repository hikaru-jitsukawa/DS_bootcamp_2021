    <p>My name is Hikaru Jitsukawa (he/him).</p>
    <p>This summer, I am working with the Migration Encounters Project, which catalogues the experiences of undocumented immigrants to America who have returned to Mexico. Here is a link to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/27/opinion/mexico-deportation-immigration-reform.html">New York Times opinion piece</a> discussing the project, and here is a link to the <a href="https://www.migrationencounters.org/">Migration Encounters webpage</a>.</p>
    <p>My favorite summer food is Ceviche - though it's not something I get a chance to eat very often.</p>
